_DESCRIPTION = """\
This paper introduces FrenchMedMCQA, the first publicly available Multiple-Choice \
Question Answering (MCQA) dataset in French for medical domain. It is composed of  \
3,105 questions taken from real exams of the French medical specialization diploma \
in pharmacy, mixing single and multiple answers. Each instance of the dataset contains \
an identifier, a question, five possible answers and their manual correction(s).  \
We also propose first baseline models to automatically process this MCQA task in  \
order to report on the current performances and to highlight the difficulty of the  \
task. A detailed analysis of the results showed that it is necessary to have  \
representations adapted to the medical domain or to the MCQA task: in our case,  \
English specialized models yielded better results than generic French ones, even though  \
FrenchMedMCQA is in French. Corpus, models and tools are available online.
